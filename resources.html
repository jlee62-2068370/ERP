        <p>
          The ERP team has curated a wide variety of
          educational resources with the help of professionals in healthcare and
          education to spread awareness on the importance of bystander
          preparedness for medical emergencies. To learn more about how you can
          help, check out some of ERP's additional content here!

            “The Golden Hour” is an animated project that aims to teach the
            essentials of bystander medicine. It is a three-episode series
            designed to be both accessible and easily interpretable by the
            average layperson and will focus on scene basics, management of ABCs
            (airway, breathing, and circulation), and proper transfer of care.
            Funding for this project was provided by the USC Bridge Art +
            Science Alliance (BASA).
